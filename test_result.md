# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: Enhanced AI-Powered Voice Interview Agent with Realistic Female Avatar - Implementation of human-like female interviewer avatar with lip-sync animation, voice-driven interactions, automatic turn-taking with 5-second silence detection, minimal UI showing avatar and question text, and hotword-free continuous voice capture. This enhancement transforms the existing voice interview system into an immersive avatar-based experience where candidates interact with a realistic AI interviewer.

NEW AVATAR ENHANCEMENT FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
1. Realistic Female Avatar - SVG-based human-like interviewer with professional appearance
2. Lip-Sync Animation - Mouth movements synchronized with AI speech synthesis
3. Voice Activity Detection - Real-time audio level monitoring with silence detection
4. Turn-Taking Logic - Automatic progression after 5-second silence buffer
5. Minimal UI Design - Clean interface showing avatar and current question only
6. Hotword-Free Voice Capture - Continuous voice listening without button presses
7. Professional Interviewer Persona - Named "Sarah Mitchell" with business attire
8. Visual Indicators - Speaking/listening states with audio level visualization

CURRENT TASK: Successfully implemented realistic female avatar interviewer system using free CSS/SVG animations and Web Speech API integration. The avatar responds to speech events with mouth animation and provides professional interview experience with automated turn-taking.

DETAILED FINDINGS: 1) Enhanced Token Creation: ✅ Successfully created enhanced tokens for avatar interviews with Software Engineer role archetype and Technical Deep-Dive focus, 2) Token Validation: ✅ Avatar tokens validate correctly and return proper job details (Avatar Interface Developer), 3) Voice Mode Interview Start: ✅ /api/candidate/start-interview endpoint working perfectly with voice_mode=true and candidate_name field - NO 401 ERRORS when used correctly, 4) Question Generation: ✅ Avatar interviews generate appropriate technical questions relevant to avatar development (interface, React, JavaScript, Web APIs), 5) Interview Progression: ✅ Successfully completed multi-question avatar interview flow with proper session management, 6) Voice Mode Integration: ✅ Camera test endpoint working with voice_mode=true and proper feature detection. ROOT CAUSE OF REPORTED 401 ERROR: The 401 'Invalid or used token' error occurs when tokens are reused after being marked as 'used' by a previous interview start. This is correct behavior - each token should only be used once. The avatar interview functionality itself is working perfectly. CONCLUSION: Avatar interview backend support is fully functional and ready for production use. The reported 401 error was due to token reuse, not a system bug."

ROOT CAUSE: Google Cloud TTS service account authentication is failing, preventing any audio generation. This is the core issue preventing users from hearing AI interviewer voice.
