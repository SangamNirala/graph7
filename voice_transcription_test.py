Voice Recording and Transcription Functionality Testing
Tests the voice recording and transcription functionality that was just implemented.

Focus Areas:
1. Backend Testing: Verify existing interview endpoints work with transcribed text from frontend
2. Voice Processing Flow: Test /api/candidate/send-message endpoint for voice-transcribed text
3. Interview Session Management: Verify voice mode interviews create sessions correctly
4. Transcript Generation: Test that voice answers appear correctly in transcripts and reports

Key Change: Voice recordings are now handled entirely on frontend using Web Speech API,
and transcribed text is sent to standard text answer submission endpoint.
